# DEFINITION
I am working as a consultant specialized in Office 365 and Azure for couple of years know. Therefor I had to work with PowerShell for a couple of tasks.

Since I started working on Office 365 I had to make my way into PowerShell. I can now say that I know a little bit of scripting with PowerShell and keep learning on it everyday. I like so mutch that PowerShell technology that I want to share it with all of the Internet and see if it can be used by others.
